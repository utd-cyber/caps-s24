    "text": "Question 1 (30 points)\nOften our data is collected with error, which we refer to as measurement error. For instance, for a dependent variable \\(Y\\) you’re trying to measure in a survey, respondents may randomly mis-click, or they may systematically lie about having a socially undesirable trait. In this question, we will explore the impact of measurement error in regression analysis in the most favourable case where the measurement error is independent of the true values. Consider the linear projection:\n\\[\nL[Y \\mid 1, X] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X\n\\]\nwith the projection error denoted as \\(e = Y - L[Y \\mid 1, X]\\), and \\(\\mathbb{V}[X] = \\sigma_X^2\\). Unfortunately, we do not observe \\(Y\\) or \\(X\\) but instead noisy proxies for them \\(\\{\\tilde{Y}, \\tilde{X}\\}\\), where\n\\[\n\\tilde{Y} = Y + v, \\quad \\tilde{X} = X + w\n\\]\nWhere \\(v\\) is one realization from \\(V \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\sigma_{v}^{2}\\right)\\) and \\(w\\) is one realization from \\(W \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\sigma_{w}^{2}\\right)\\), where \\(W\\) and \\(V\\) are independent of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). This implies that \\(\\operatorname{Cov}(v,X)=\\operatorname{Cov}(v, e)=\\operatorname{Cov}(v, w)=\\operatorname{Cov}(w, X)=\\operatorname{Cov}(w, e)=\\operatorname{Cov}(w, v)=0\\). This is commonly referred to as classical measurement error.\n\nConsider the linear projection of these observable variables, \\(L[\\tilde{Y} \\mid 1, \\tilde{X}]=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1} \\tilde{X}\\). Find \\(\\alpha_{1}\\) in terms of \\(\\left\\{\\beta_{1}, \\sigma_{w}^{2}, \\sigma_{v}^{2}, \\sigma_{X}^{2}\\right\\}\\). Hint: first derive an expression of the coefficients in terms of the \\(\\tilde{X}\\) and \\(\\tilde{Y}\\).\nFrom your expression in part (a), briefly explain (1-2 sentences) the effect of this type of measurement error in \\(X\\) on the sign and magnitude of the coefficient \\(\\alpha_{1}\\) compared to \\(\\beta_{1}\\). Hint: what parameter controls the amount of measurement error in \\(X\\)?\nFrom your expression in part (a), briefly explain (1-2 sentences) the effect of this type of measurement error in \\(Y\\) on the sign and magnitude of the coefficient \\(\\alpha_1\\) compared to \\(\\beta_1\\).

You should explain each step in any derivation so that both you and the grader can understand what you are doing. This is useful since (a) it helps reinforce the concept for your own understanding, (b) conveys to the grader (and eventually the world) that you understand the concepts that you are using, and (c) helps the grader debug any potential problems with the derivation to provide the highest quality feedback.\nWhen working with mathematical probability and statistics, success usually comes from pattern matching: this problem is isomorphic to some other problem that we’ve done before. Doing that pattern matching takes some experience, but it’s often help to try and strip a problem of its extraneous detail and focus on what the core elements are. Then, if you can’t see the path forward, try to find a problem that we (or the textbooks) have solved that has the same core elements.",
